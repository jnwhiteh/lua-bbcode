# Lua-BBCode - A Lua parser for BBCode

This is a simple project to produce a limited BBCode parser built in Lua using
LPEG. In the future I would like to extend and make the parser a bit more
general, however getting it to a working state for the following tags is my
priority:

Block level tags:
  * [quote]

Inline tags:
  * [b]
  * [i]
  * [u]
  * [s]
  * [url]
  * [url=http://www.example.com]
  * [img]
  * [img=http://www.example.com/foo.png]
  * [code]

If you are interested in contributing to this project, please contact me.
